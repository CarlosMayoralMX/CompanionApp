The sources for the Companion App serve as a reference implementation of the push, geofencing, and analytics features of the Kumulos platform.

The app is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and showcases how to embed the native Android & iOS SDKs into a cross-platform project, then communicate with the SDKs from the app code.
